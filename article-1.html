                            <p>Think about how <strong>you</strong> learned to recognize risk in your career. No one handed you a rulebook on day one that covered every scenario. Instead, you absorbed patterns over years. You reviewed financial statements, observed market cycles, sat through hundreds of meetings, and gradually built an internal framework that allowed you to evaluate new situations with reasonable accuracy.</p>
                            <p class="analogy-punchline">That framework is your mental model — and it was trained on decades of experience.</p>

                    <p>Artificial intelligence follows the same principle, compressed into silicon. An AI system is software that has been exposed to large volumes of data and, through mathematical processes, has extracted patterns from that data. When presented with a new input, the system uses those patterns to produce an output: a prediction, a classification, a recommendation, or in the case of generative AI, entirely new text, images, or code.</p>

                    <p>The critical distinction is <strong>scale and speed</strong>.

Where your pattern recognition is shaped by personal experience and cognitive biases, an AI model's patterns are shaped entirely by its training data — for better or for worse.</p>

                                <p>AI does not reason the way a human does. It performs <em>probabilistic inference</em> — a precise way of saying it makes the most statistically likely guess based on what it has seen before.</p>

                            <p>When a generative AI model writes a sentence, it is predicting the next most probable word given all the previous words. When a fraud detection model flags a transaction, it is calculating the probability that the transaction's features match patterns learned from known fraud cases.</p>

                    <p>A model trained on general internet text can discuss nearly any topic but lacks deep expertise in any one domain. A model trained specifically on regulatory filings, actuarial tables, and insurance policy language will be far more precise in that domain but may struggle with tasks outside of it.</p>

                    <p>This is where <strong>fine-tuning</strong> becomes relevant. Organizations can take a general-purpose model and further train it on proprietary data to specialize its behavior. A life insurer, for example, could fine-tune a language model on its claims correspondence, policy documents, and underwriting guidelines so that the model produces outputs aligned with the organization's specific terminology and business logic.</p>
